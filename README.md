# rock_Paper_scissors
For this project, I am working on implementing the knowledge I have gained so far relating to Javascript. I will try to use these basic concepts like different data types( strings, numbers, objects) and create functions from them in order to serve the purpose of making a game of rock paper scissors(hopefully for loop). I will try to use if, else statements or anything I can think of. To play, open up the js console in your broswer using the keys option + command + J for Mac (or the equivalent for other OS's). If there are any hiccups(blank console) just reload the page.
